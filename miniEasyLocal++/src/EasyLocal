    framework and the template definition that must be instantiated.
    
    It must be included in any project that uses the framework.

/**
   @mainpage miniEasyLocal++ documentation

   This set of pages contains an online reference manual of the EasyLocal++
   framework. It is still incomplete, but we plan to extend it (hopefully) 
   soon.

   Further informations on how to employ the framework in the development
   of an actual application are available in the following paper:
   @li L. Di Gaspero and A. Schaerf.

       design of local search  algorithms.

   Some informations about how to compile an application that uses
   the framework classes can be found in the
