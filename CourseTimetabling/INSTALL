   CourseTimetabling Installation

       --------------------------------------------------------------

        

     What is needed

       In order to install and use the EasyLocal++ solver for the Course
       Timetabling problem you must be sure that the target machine provides,
       at least, the following components (an up-to-date Linux distribution
       should fulfill all the requirements, as well as the Cygwin environment
       under Windows 95/98/ME).

          *  GNU gzip version > 1.2
          *  GNU g++ compiler version > 2.95.2
          *  GNU make version > 3.78
          *  miniEasyLocal++ version > 0.1

       The software has been tested with the above specified configuration,
       although, in principle, it could be used with different compilers and
       different versions of the above mentioned tools. Yet, the details on
       how to port the software on different compilers/tools platforms is out
       of the scope of this document. 

     Installing the software

       To install the software you have to unpack the file
       CourseTimetabling.tar.gz in the target directory by typing:

       > gunzip -c CourseTimetabling.tar.gz | tar -xf -

       This command will create a directory called CourseTimetabling/ which
       contains all the source files.

     Compiling the software

       Once you are sure that the set of tools required are provided, in order
       to compile the software you have to edit the Makefile to let the
       compiler point to the EasyLocal++ installation. Please, notice that
       before doing this you should have properly installed the EasyLocal++
       distribution and compiled the EasyLocal++ library.

       There is only a line which should be edited:

       EASYLOCALDIR = /your/EasyLocal++/path

       Then simply type: 

       > make
       in the root directory of the distribution and the compilation starts.
       The outcome of the process is an executable file named course_tt.exe.

     Using the software

       To run the CourseTimetabling program type: 
       > course_tt.exe
       from the CourseTimetabling/ directory. The program prompts for a set of
       data files to be used. In this distribution we provide only the data of
       the first term, therefore the only possible choice is data 1.
